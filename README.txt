1.The project can run perfectly if all of your configuration are correct.
If you encounter any problems when using the project, donâ€™t hesitate to contact me!

2.The external image is some example to choose when you use user_image_upload function, you can of course use your own image as well.

3.Database function base on SQLHelper class to accomplish all the connecting, accessing, selecting, updating and release resource operation. So there is no need to construct Zend_Db_Table any more. Please let me know if this kind of method is appropriate in website building. I would be grateful if you can give me some advice.
